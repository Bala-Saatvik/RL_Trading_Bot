# RL_Trading_Bot

The code is a Streamlit-based web application that simulates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based trading bot. The application generates a stock price dataset, allows the user to train a simple RL agent, and simulates trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on the trained agent. It then calculates the profit from these trading actions and provides insights and an interactive plot of the stock prices and trading signals.
